# Function 1
This function is a function with a 1D output and a 2D input. The goal of this project is to optimize it.

This is the description of the function: Detect likely contamination sources in a two-dimensional area, such as a radiation field, where only proximity yields a non-zero reading. The system uses Bayesian optimisation to tune detection parameters and reliably identify both strong and weak sources.
